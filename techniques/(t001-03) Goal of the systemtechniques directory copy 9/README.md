## Context

A system’s goals determine its behaviors. Changing goals can mutate every lower leverage point to suit the system’s new goals[[2](#2)]. Therefore, changing the goals of the system changes every item listed above: parameters, feedback loops, information and self-organization[[1](#1)].

## Examples
### Example 1

A city council decision might be to change the goal of the lake from making it a free facility for public and private use, to a more tourist oriented facility or a conservation area. That goal change will effect several of the above leverage points: information on water quality will become mandatory and legal punishment will be set for any illegal effluent[[1](#1)].
