`<image>`

## Context

In a system, decisions and well-functioning feedback loops often require information. In contrast, missing information can lead to system malfunction. People without information cannot make decisions to meet the system goals. The leverage point is then to provide the right information in the right form[[2](#2)]. It is cheaper and easier to change information flows than it is to change structure[[1](#1)].
