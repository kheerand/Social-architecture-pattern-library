# (T001-09) Length of delays (relative to the rate of system changes)

<image>

## Context

Delays in feedback loops tend to cause oscillations. Information received too quickly or too late can cause over or underreaction, even oscillations[[1](#1)].  In turn, oscillations worsen the effectiveness of your decisions, because you’re making decisions with delayed information. Furthermore, the results of your actions are delayed—by the time your actions have results, the situation may have changed so that your actions have become inappropriate[[2](#2)].

Changing the length of delays affects system behavior:
* Delays that are too short cause overreaction, leading to higher-frequency oscillations.
* Delays set just right can dampen oscillations and introduce stability.
* Delays that are too long can lead to exploding oscillations, or push a system past a breaking point beyond which it cannot return (such as overfishing to extinction).

## Examples

### Example 1

The city council is considering building the wastewater treatment plant. However, the plant will take 5 years to be built, and will last about 30 years. The first delay will prevent the water being cleaned up within the first 5 years, while the second delay will make it impossible to build a plant with exactly the right capacity[[1](#1)].
