# (T001-5) Rules of the system (such as incentives, punishment, constraints)

<image>

## Context

A system’s rules define its boundaries. These include national constitutions, laws, incentives, punishments, and contracts. Changing the rules can dramatically change behavior. In a well-functioning system, good rules are set that achieve the system’s goals.  However, bad rules invite counterproductive evasion or cause actors to chase the wrong goal.

## Technique

Pay attention to rules, and to who makes them[[1](#1)].
