# (T001-11) The size of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows

<image>

## Context

A buffer's ability to stabilize a system is important when the stock amount is much higher than the potential amount of inflows or outflows. In the lake, the water is the buffer: if there's a lot more of it than inflow/outflow, the system stays stable.  Buffers can improve a system, but they are often physical entities whose size is critical and can't be changed easily[[1](#1)].

Buffer's are stocks in the system that can stabilize the system over fluctuating flow rates. For example a bank account is a stock of money that helps withstand volatility
between income and expenses.  Changing the stock changes the behavior of the system. You can stabilize a system by increasing the stock, but this comes at the cost of efficiencyâ€”larger stocks cost more to build or maintain. In contrast, you can increase efficiency by decreasing the stock, but this comes at the cost of lower robustness.

## Examples

### Example 1

Just-in-time manufacturing decreases the size of the inventory while relying on more frequent deliveries. This makes it more agile to shifting customer demand, but makes it more vulnerable to supply disruptions[[2](#2)].

### Example 2

The inhabitants are worried the lake fish might die as a consequence of hot water release directly in the lake without any previous cooling off. However, the water in the lake has a large heat capacity, so it's a strong thermic buffer. Provided the release is done at low enough depth, under the thermocline, and the lake volume is big enough, the buffering capacity of the water might prevent any extinction from excess temperature[[1](#1)].
