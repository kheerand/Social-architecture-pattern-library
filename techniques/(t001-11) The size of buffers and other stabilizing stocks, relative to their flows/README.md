# (T001-11) The size of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows

<image>

## Context

A buffer's ability to stabilize a system is important when the stock amount is much higher than the potential amount of inflows or outflows. In the lake, the water is the buffer: if there's a lot more of it than inflow/outflow, the system stays stable.  Buffers can improve a system, but they are often physical entities whose size is critical and can't be changed easily[[1](#1)].

## Examples

For example, the inhabitants are worried the lake fish might die as a consequence of hot water release directly in the lake without any previous cooling off. However, the water in the lake has a large heat capacity, so it's a strong thermic buffer. Provided the release is done at low enough depth, under the thermocline, and the lake volume is big enough, the buffering capacity of the water might prevent any extinction from excess temperature[[1](#1)].
