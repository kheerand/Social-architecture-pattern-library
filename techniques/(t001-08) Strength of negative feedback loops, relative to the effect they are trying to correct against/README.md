# (T001-08) Strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the effect they are trying to correct against

<image>

## Context

Strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the effect they are trying to correct against[[1](#1)].  A balancing feedback loop keeps a stock at a setpoint. 

It can be broken down into components and parameters[[2](#2)]:
1. The speed and accuracy of monitoring
1. The speed and intensity of the response
1. The flows by which the response achieves its goal

## Technique

Each of [twelve leverage points](../(T001)%20Leverage%20points%20to%20intervene%20in%20a%20system/README.md) in a system can be used for changing how the balancing feedback loop works.

A key requirement in developing the balancing feedback loop should be designed to be strong enough to regulate whatever itâ€™s regulating. If the feedback loop is too weak for the system changes, it will fail to keep the stock at its desired setpoint.

### Example 1

One way to avoid the lake getting more and more polluted might be through setting up an additional levy on the industrial plant based on measured concentrations of its effluent. Say the plant management has to pay into a water management fund, on a weekly or monthly basis, depending on the actual amount of waste found in the lake; they will, in this case, receive a direct benefit not just from reducing their waste output, but actually reducing it enough to achieve the desired effect of reducing concentrations in the lake. They cannot benefit from "doing damage more slowly" -- only from actually helping. If cutting emissions, even to zero, is insufficient to allow the lake to naturally purge the waste, then they will still be on the hook for cleanup. This is similar to the US "Superfund" system, and follows the widely accepted "polluter pays" principle[[1](#1)].
