# (T001-2) Mindset or paradigm that the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises from

<image>

## Context

A societal paradigm is an idea, a shared unstated assumption, or a system of thought that is the foundation of complex social structures. A system’s paradigms are its implicit beliefs about how the world works. They’re often so deeply ingrained in our minds that we don’t consciously articulate them—there’s no need to, because we believe everyone else believes them too[[2](#2)].

These paradigms are so natural we don’t often think about them, yet they govern much of what we do. These paradigms drive every lower leverage point—the system goals, the information flows, and so on. These paradigms govern how we set up rules around property ownership, how we set up systems for social welfare, and how we reward system actors that produce growth. 

Paradigms are very hard to change, but there are no limits to paradigm change. Meadows indicates paradigms might be changed by repeatedly and consistently pointing out anomalies and failures in the current paradigm to those with open minds[[1](#1)].

## Examples
### Example 1

A current paradigm is "Nature is a stock of resources to be converted to human purpose". What might happen to the lake were this collective idea changed?[[1](#1)]

### Example 2

In Western societies, we have these paradigms:

* Money represents value. Someone who has more money is more valuable than someone who has less of it.
* It’s possible for someone to “own” land on this planet.
* Growth is good. Continuous improvement is good, and stasis is bad.
