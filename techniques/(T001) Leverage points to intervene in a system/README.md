# (t001) Leverage points to intervene in a system

<image>

## Context

Donella Meadows proposed The twelve leverage points to intervene in a system.  These provide useful set of tools to identify points for intervening a system [1].

## Technique

### Twelve points to intervene

These are listed in increasing order of effectiveness.
