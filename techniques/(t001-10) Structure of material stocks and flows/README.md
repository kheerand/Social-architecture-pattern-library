# (T001-10) Stock and flow structure (of material) 

<image>

## Context

A system's structure may have enormous effect on operations, but may be difficult or prohibitively expensive to change. Fluctuations, limitations, and bottlenecks may be easier to address[[1](#1)].

Changing the stock-and-flow structure means changing which flows are connected to which stocks. This can change the behavior of the system.

## Examples

### Example 1

The inhabitants are worried about their lake getting polluted, as the industry releases chemical pollutants directly in the water without any previous treatment. The system might need the used water to be diverted to a wastewater treatment plant, but this requires rebuilding the underground used water system (which could be quite expensive)[[1](#1)].

### Example 2

A government could change how money flowsâ€”currently it receives taxation from citizens and allocates budget to departments, which then returns to citizens. Changing the structure of this could lead to different system behaviors[[2](#2)].
