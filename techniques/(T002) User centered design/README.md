## Context

User-centered design (UCD) is a design philosophy and process in which the needs, wants, and limitations of the end users of a product or service are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process. The goal of UCD is to create products and services that are usable, accessible, and useful to the intended users.

## Technique

The UCD process typically includes several stages, such as user research, design, testing, and evaluation.

1. User research: This stage involves gathering information about the users, including their demographics, needs, goals, and tasks. This information is used to identify user requirements and to develop user personas, which are fictional characters that represent the different types of users.

2. Design: In this stage, the information gathered in the user research stage is used to design the product or service. This includes creating wireframes, mock-ups, and prototypes that are tested with users to ensure that the design meets their needs.

3. Testing: This stage involves testing the design with users to identify any issues or problems. This can include usability testing, where users are asked to perform tasks using the product or service, and user feedback, where users are asked for their opinions about the design.

4. Evaluation: In this stage, the results of the testing are analyzed to identify any issues or problems and to make changes to the design. This stage also includes monitoring the usage of the final product to ensure that it is meeting the needs of the users.

By using UCD, designers can create products and services that are more usable, accessible, and useful to the intended users, resulting in a better user experience. UCD also helps to identify user's needs and preferences that are diverse and inclusive, and create a system that is usable and accessible to all users.
