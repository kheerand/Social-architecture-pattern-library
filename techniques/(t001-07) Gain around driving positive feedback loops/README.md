# (T001-7) Gain around driving positive feedback loops

<image>

## Context

A positive, reinforcing feedback loop speeds up a process. Reinforcing feedback loops grow exponentially; left unchecked, they can cause serious, irreversible damage to a system. 

## Technique

The leverage point for reinforcing feedback loops is its gain, or its growth rate.

Often, reinforcing feedback loops are countered by balancing feedback loops. An intuitive response to controlling a reinforcing feedback loop is to strengthen the balancing feedback loop. But itâ€™s often easier to simply reduce the growth rate of the reinforcing feedback loop, to keep it more manageable[[2](#2)].

In most cases, it is preferable to slow down a positive loop, rather than speeding up a negative one[[1](#1)].

## Examples
### Example 1

The eutrophication of a lake is a typical feedback loop that goes wild. In a eutrophic lake (which means well-nourished), much life, including fish, can be supported. An increase of nutrients will lead to an increase of productivity, growth of phytoplankton first, using up as much nutrients as possible, followed by growth of zooplankton, feeding up on the first ones, and increase of fish populations. The more available nutrients there are, the more productivity is increased. As plankton organisms die, they fall to the bottom of the lake, where their matter is degraded by decomposers. However, this degradation uses up available oxygen, and in the presence of huge amounts of organic matter to degrade, the medium progressively becomes anoxic (there is no more oxygen available). In time, all oxygen-dependent life dies, and the lake becomes a smelly anoxic place where no life can be supported (in particular no fish)[[1](#1)].
