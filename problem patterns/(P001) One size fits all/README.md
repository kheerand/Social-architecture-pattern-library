# (P001) One size fits all

## Context

Expectation that one solution pattern can fit many or all problems.  

## Problem

A common trap that can be observed is the assumption that a well marketed solution (think Agile, SaFE, ITIL, Human centered design etc.) can be successfully applied to many or all problem patterns with equal success.  This is specially true when it is applied with little adaptation to meet the context in which it is applied in.

## Consequence of problem

If the context is right, this can lead to good outcomes.  Equally, if the context is not correct, then it will lead to suboptimal results or failure.
