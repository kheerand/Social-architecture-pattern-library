## Problem

In complex social systems that are composed of many different actors and organizations and their internal dynamics can be difficult to
  predict and control. Traditional forms of governance, such as hierarchical or centralized models, are often not well-suited to dealing 
  with the complexity and dynamism of these systems. 
  

## Consequence of problem

  These models rely on a single authority or hierarchy to make decisions and manage the system, and they are often not be able to
  effectively coordinate and cooperate with the many different actors and organizations involved.
  
## Solution patterns

A networked governance aims to address these challenges by leveraging the resources and expertise of a wide 
range of actors and organizations. Instead of relying on a single authority or hierarchy, networked governance emphasizes the importance
of collaboration, coordination, and communication among different actors. This allows for a more flexible and adaptive approach to
decision-making and problem-solving, as well as greater participation and engagement of all stakeholders.
