# 007 - Sustaining a burgeoning community 

`<image>`

## Context

A successful system will have a community around it that finds it useful.  If the system is useful for a broad group, then the community around the system will grow over time.

## Problem

As the community around the system grows, sustaining this burgening community brings a set of new challenges.  

The following issues start to gain prominence as the community grows,
- voice of the individual gets lost
-  complexity of connections increase exponentially 
- quality of personal connections are reduced
- sensemaking of the community needs, Challenges etc become harder
- fractions and sub communities
- flow of information across the community is challenging and becomes fragmented and blocked.
	- also can end up with Chinese whispers problem
- real and perceived fairness of governance and participation becomes more important
