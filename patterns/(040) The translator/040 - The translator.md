# 040 - The translator

<image>

## Context

Different communities or disciplines have varying meaning attached to language and have different sematics. 

## Problem

When people from different communities work together, communication of meaning can be lost in the translation between those from the different commnunities.  This causes confusion, distrust and failure to progress the task at hand.

## Consequence of problem

- The Translator act as the connective tissue between the communities or disciplines.
- Lack of translators in cross community or discipline groups can lead to mistrust, breakdown in communication and utlimately failed projects.

> **NOTE:**
> These consequences need tweaking to match the heading.  eg: 1st one is not a consequence of the problem, but of applying the solution.

## Solution patterns

People who are familiar with both communities and understand the purpose, intent and context in which both communities operate in can act as translators in such projects.  Such people, can become a bridge between the communities by being able to translate what is said by one community in a way that is understandable by the other community, with minimal loss of intended meaning.  Thus they act as binding tissue between multiple communities.

When establishing teams that come from different communities or disciplines, look to include translators into the project to act as the binding tissue between the communities or disciplines.
