## (E001.1) Taxonomy sub-groups

## Background

Taxonomy is a field that has existed for a long time and has very mature practices.  However, in the informatics age, having a bioligical taxonomy reference has been quite challenging.  It has been quite difficult to establish an effective taxonomic reference.

## Description

Upon analysis it was found that taxonomy has emerged into a number of sub-disciples:

1. Taxonomic research
2. Taxon management
3. Taxon name management

Historically, all three of these were performed by a taxonomist.  This was fine while the rate of change in taxonomy was slow, and the amount of reference to taxnomic classifications was low.  However, in the digital, data age, there is increased need for taxon management and taxon name management.

In the absence of trained taxonmist, these emergent needs have been filled by others where they have developed practices to work around the challenges.
