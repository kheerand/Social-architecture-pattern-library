# (001) Mosaic of sub-cultures

## Context

## Problem

A discipline group consists of a number of sub-disciplines which while broadly related are sufficiently different that their needs, cultures and work practices don't necessarily have a high degree of overlap.


## Solution patterns

1. Recognition that sub-cultures exists and identifying the sub-cultures that exist.
2. Working towards establishing common languages, specially in areas that have overlapping needs or activities.
3. Developing social scafolding to encourage constructive participation and discourage destructive participation between sub-cultures.
