# (030) Connected ~~buildings~~systems

![](images/image001.png)

## Context

Systems rarely exist in isolation.  A system needs to be connected to other systems around it.

## Problem

Only a small set of niche systems have utility in isolation of other systems around it.  In general, a system that exists in isolation
ends up having limited utility `[ref network effect]`.

Sometimes this is because interconnection was not considered `[expand on this]`

Other times it is because there is insufficient relationship and trust between the system owners to remove the social barriers for achieving technical interconnection between systems `[expand on this]`.

## Consequence of problem

When systems that should be connected are not connected together, it results in increased barriers for frictionless flow of information.  Furthermore, as middleware (be it human or machine) needs to be introduced to bridge the void of systems not being connected, it introduces increased cost and errors.

## Solution patterns

Build systems from inception to be interoperable and work with other systems around it.  This can be done by,

- The use of well defined APIs for system-to-system interfaces enables interconnection of systems.
- The adoption of standards, specially open standards makes it easier to build and maintain interconnected systems.
