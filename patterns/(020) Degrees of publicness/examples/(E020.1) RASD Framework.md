## (E020.1) Restricted Access Species Data Framework

**`STATUS:`** `Very early draft of example. Only captures the key thoughts.`

## Background

The data of many fauna and flora species are restricted for a range of reasons (primary one being the conservation
status of the species in a given jurisdiction).  However, this data is vital for certain groups of people to know.

## Description

While there is very good reason for this data to be restricted, this data is vital for certain groups of people.
The RASD Framework is aiming to increase the trust circle between Australian state governement agencies for the
restricted access species data held in various government data systems.

The government agencies, which undertakes modelling, conservation actions and approvals for land disturbances, 
require this data from their counterparts.  However, due to the private or public model being applied for the publicness of the data, the sharing of this data has been problematic.  The framework is inteded to facilitate the establishment
of a broader group that has previlaged access to this data, while not making the data completely public.  That is, it is
looking to establish a 'data club'.
