# (004) Long term stewardship of data and software

`<image here>`

## Context

Data and software assets need long-term stewardship and ongoing curation as they have long term value.  However, much of the data and software is generated through temporary activities such as projects.

## Problem

Left alone, data and software assets tend to deteriorate in its usefulness.  They require active curation for the entire life of the assets.  However, the best vehicle for this stewardship is not often clear once the original temoporary activity that created them has ended.

## Solution patterns

1. Establish durable infrastructure designed to serve as a permanent repository for data and software assets generated by 
   transient activities such as projects.
1. Appoint dedicated custodians for these infrastructures, who will have responsibility for long-term stewardship of the assets 
   held by the infrastructures.
1. Ensure the sustainability of these infrastructures through reliable funding, fostering trust within the relevant communities by 
   presenting these facilities as enduring or 'perpetual' resources[1].
1. Create pathways for the transfer of data and software assets from transient projects to these infrastructures.
1. Incentivise the use of the pathways to transfer data and software assets to the long-term infrastructures.
1. Where possible attempts should be made to establish temporary activity within or in association with long-term institutional 
   structures in order to provide a path for long-term stewardship of the resulting data.

### NOTES

[1]  While very long-term sustainability is always debatable, there is usually a time horizon in each community and domain of 
     knowledge where something can be considered practically 'perpetual'.  The sustainability should be thought of in this light
	 where long-term needs be sufficient for the community of concern has confidence that the infrastructure can be considered
	 'perpetual'.

## Examples

> **NOTE**:  
> Data commons is a good example of this.  In particular the Global Data commons framework that RDA are working on
> provides the mechanisms by which such durable infrastructure can be established.
