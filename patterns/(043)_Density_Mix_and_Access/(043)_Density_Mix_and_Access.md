# (043) Density, Mix and Access

![](patterns/(043)_Density_Mix_and_Access/images/DMA_diagrams.png)


## Context

In planning an ecosystem that is able to self-sustain, the density, mix and access dimensions provide a good axises along which to consider.

## Problem

A self-sustaining ecosystem of technology requires a combination of density, mix and access across its components in a similar manner to an urban area requiring a mix of these three to make it viable and vibrant.

## Consequence of problem

If each of these dimensions are not considered adequately it results in the ecosystem not being able to become self-sustainable.  It can fail to inspire and attract new users

## Solution patterns

** Density ** provides the required density of any component to make it useful.  For example, the data from one state may not be sufficient if the scope is that of the wphone nation.

** Mix ** considers the heterogenaity required in the system.

** Access ** considers the closeness of components to each other.
