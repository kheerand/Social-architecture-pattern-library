## Context

Projects, initiatives, facilities when initially established are in a startup phase and have a number of characteristics that are typical for a startup.  When these are carefully or serendipitously used the startup tends to survive and grow.

## Problem

The startup phase of a project, initiative or facility is a critical period, and if a number of key characteristics are needed to give it the best change to survive and grow.  While these can occur serendipitously, careful attention to these can help establish these characteristics with increased certainty.

## Consequence of problem

Failure to establish these characteristics increases the likelihood of failure.  If established, it can thrive and grow beyond the startup phase.

## Solution patterns

Some patterns associated with this are,
- Entrepreneurial mindset
