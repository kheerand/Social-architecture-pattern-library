# (034) Attracting (the right) users

<image>

## Context

The virtual research environments that aims to bring together several distinct disciplines but we see that one of the key challenges is in getting the two groups to work together.

## Problem

The uptake of cross disciplinary Virtual Laboratory/data facility is not as extensive across our target communities as had been anticipated.

## Consequence of problem


## Solution patterns

Identify target users and user communities and then identify modes to reach these users.  Reach out through these modes to raise awareness of Virtual Laboratory/data facility and also to understand their specific needs and barriers to adopting the service.  Tune the way the service is delivered to meet these needs to lower the barriers for adoption.
Look to identify local champions for the VL/datta facility within these user communities and provide them support and incentives to promote the service.
