# (036) Pioneers, settlers & town planners

<image>

## Context

Different personalities lend to favour different stages of evolution.

- Pioneers, have an ability to ideate and innovate.
- Settlers, have the ability to take innovations and make them robust products
- Town Planners, have the ability to take a product and make it robust and scale and build in efficiencies.

## Problem

There is little attention given to matching the personality with the role at hand.

## Consequence of problem


## Solution patterns

Utilising techniques such as [Wardley mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardley_map), understand the evolutionary stage that something is at, and match the people with the right personality to it.

Have teams with similar personality types for each stage of evolution.

Create an environment where Settlers can steal ideas from Pioneers to build products, Town planners can steal from Settlers to grow and expand services, and Pioneers can use what Town planners have build as a platform to build new ideas.
