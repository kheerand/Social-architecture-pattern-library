# (028) Main building

<image>

## Context

In a networked system that relates to the same kind of information, typically each entity has systems that are similar in function.  

> **NOTE:**
> Relating to pattern 27, I think there needs to be a main "building" that the "building complex" is clustered around.

## Problem

When a user is interacting with such a complex system, it can lead to confusion as to which of the may similar systems is the main starting point.

## Consequence of problem



## Solution patterns

- Similar to having a 'main building' in a building complex to give a focal point or starting point for the entire building complex, establish a *main system* that acts as the focal point for the cluster of systems.
- A 'main building' within a building complex doesn't diminish the value or the utility of each of the other buildings within the complex, when done correctly, establishing a *main system* does not need to diminish the value of significance of other systems.
