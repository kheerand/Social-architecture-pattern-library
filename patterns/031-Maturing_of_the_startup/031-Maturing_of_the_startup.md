# (031) Maturing of the startup

## Context


## Problem

Projects that begin life in a (10) Startup pattern when successful grow and hit a tipping point in their existence.  This occurs when they no longer have to go seeking people to use what the project provides, and instead people come seeking to make use of what they provide.  At this point the characteristics that made the project succeed till now fail to provide the same level of value and often impede it.  At this point different characteristics are needed if the project is to continue to survive and grow.
