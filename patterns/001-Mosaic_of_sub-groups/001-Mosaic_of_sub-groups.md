# (001) Mosaic of sub-cultures

## Context

## Problem

A discipline group consists of a number of sub-disciplines which while broadly related are sufficiently different that their needs, cultures and work practices don't have a high degree of overlap.  

## Solution patterns
> [!warning] this info is not right and needs correction. 


1. Recognition that sub-cultures exists and identifying the sub-cultures that exist.
2. Working towards establishing common languages, specially in areas that have overlapping needs or activities.
3. Developing social scaffolding to encourage constructive participation and discourage destructive participation between sub-cultures.
4. [User-centered design](../../../techniques/(T002)%20User%20centered%20design/README.md) to design focuses on understanding the needs, preferences, and behaviours of the users of the system. By understanding the diversity of the user base and designing the system to be inclusive and responsive to the needs of different groups, the information system can be more inclusive and accessible to all users.
5. Diversity and Inclusion training: Providing training for employees and stakeholders on diversity, inclusion and cultural sensitivity can help create a culture that is inclusive and responsive to the needs of different groups.
6. Encourage participation and feedback: Creating opportunities for users to provide feedback and participate in the development and maintenance of the system can help create a culture of inclusivity and collaboration. This can be achieved through user testing and feedback sessions, online forums, and other methods of engagement.
7. Monitoring and measuring progress: Monitoring and measuring progress on diversity, inclusion and cultural sensitivity in the system regularly can help identify any areas that need improvement and ensure that the system is remaining inclusive over time.
