# (001) Mosaic of sub-cultures

## Context

## Problem

A discipline group consists of a number of sub-disciplines which while broadly related are sufficiently different that their needs, cultures and work practices don't have a high degree of overlap.  Traditionally, architecture and urban design have often been based on a monoculture, homogeneous approach, which can lead to the exclusion of certain groups and a lack of representation.  This can result in an environment that does not reflect the diversity of the community it serves.

In a socio-technical information system, the technical aspect of the system are the hardware, software, and network infrastructure that make up the system. The social aspect of the system refers to the people who interact with and use the technical elements, such as the users, system administrators, and developers.

The concept of a "mosaic of sub-cultures" in architecture addresses the need for the technical elements of the information system to be inclusive and responsive to the diverse social groups that use them. This includes not only designing the information system to reflect the diversity of the community, but also creating systems and processes that are inclusive and responsive to the diverse needs of the community.

For example, in a information system, it would mean considering the accessibility needs of different users and providing interfaces that cater to the different cultures, languages and working styles of the community it serves. It would also mean creating opportunities for engagement and participation by the community in the information system's activities.

By addressing the interactions and relationships between the technical and social aspects of the information system, the concept of a "mosaic of sub-cultures" in architecture can help create a information system that is not only functional and efficient, but also inclusive and responsive to the diverse needs of the community it serves.

1. Recognition that sub-cultures exists and identifying the sub-cultures that exist.
2. Working towards establishing common languages, specially in areas that have overlapping needs or activities.
3. Developing social scaffolding to encourage constructive participation and discourage destructive participation between sub-cultures.
4. [User-centered design](../../../techniques/(T002)%20User%20centered%20design/README.md) to design focuses on understanding the needs, preferences, and behaviours of the users of the system. By understanding the diversity of the user base and designing the system to be inclusive and responsive to the needs of different groups, the information system can be more inclusive and accessible to all users.
5. Diversity and Inclusion training: Providing training for employees and stakeholders on diversity, inclusion and cultural sensitivity can help create a culture that is inclusive and responsive to the needs of different groups.
6. Encourage participation and feedback: Creating opportunities for users to provide feedback and participate in the development and maintenance of the system can help create a culture of inclusivity and collaboration. This can be achieved through user testing and feedback sessions, online forums, and other methods of engagement.
7. Monitoring and measuring progress: Monitoring and measuring progress on diversity, inclusion and cultural sensitivity in the system regularly can help identify any areas that need improvement and ensure that the system is remaining inclusive over time.
