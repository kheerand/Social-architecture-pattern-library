## Context

> **NOTE:**
> Possibly an anti-pattern

Digital transformation needed to support online delivery of data and digital collections, and analytics, in novel web and cloud delivery services (and new commercial services) 

## Problem

Lack of resources and senior management and board confidence or buy-in 
Traditional attitudes work practices and role descriptions e.g. IT “does data and technology”

No new roles in digital collections areas that require a mix of professional skills e.g. data architect, data analyst, data scientist to tackle digital transformation effectively
Resistance and controlling behaviour from traditional and high status experts 
Leadership and expertise lies in digital transformation in mid tier operatives
Buy-in of consultants at high cost with limited value in terms of practice change 
Technical leaders hung-up on new tech and project tools like “technology roadmaps” that are useless for keeping key stakeholders on board.       

## Consequence of problem

Inability to: innovate around work practices with data and technology and major collections of public digital assets; and develop data-centric services useful to operations management and utility of digital collections  

## Solution patterns

A combination of top-down and bottom-up is rarely seen but the most effective.  The top-down approach only occurs once senior management buy-in has occurred.  The key to success is securing buy-in and demonstrating value with key stakeholders.

As precursors to more sustained change:

    Anti-patterns (the creeping ivy effect) arise where some leeway has been given for “digital work” to be appended to existing services e.g. marketing, public programs, or asset discovery services, but progress is significantly slowed.  Shadow IT projects occur as “special projects” that can force change in spurts by demonstrating value (but this infrastructure is fragile if not progressed to BAU).     

## Related Patterns


## Examples

Public sector institutions holding digital collections in the form of public survey and transaction data, and material culture or natural history collections.
