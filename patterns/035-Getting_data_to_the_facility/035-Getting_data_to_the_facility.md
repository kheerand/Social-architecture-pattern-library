# (035) Getting data to the facility

## Context

> **NOTE:**
> Is this an anti-pattern?
  
> **NOTE:**
> This is too research focused, but the pattern is valid.  Generalise it further.

Potential data providers are currently not contributing data to the facility.

## Problem

We have invested in a data facility to enable our researchers in the related research domain to deposit and share research data. However we know that researchers are still keeping their data to themselves and not sharing.

## Consequence of problem

- Quality control is a key; 
- If contribution to the facility is mandated it may result in poor description of data and metadata as contributors seek to comply with minimum effort (tick and flick pattern);
- <Any others?>

## Solution patterns

- Lowering the barriers to ingesting data; 
- Grants require or encourage the data generated through grant funded activities to be contributed to the related facilities;
- Incorporate facility as part of the workflow of creating & analysing the data;
- Incorporate ways that facilitates the enhancement of the data contributors reputation within their community (eg: incorporation of ORCIDs within the data and in the citations).
