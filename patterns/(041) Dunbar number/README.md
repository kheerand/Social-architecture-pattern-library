# (041) Dunbar's number

## Context

The Dunbar number, 150, also known as Dunbar's number, is a theoretical cognitive limit to the number of people with whom an individual can maintain meaningful social relationships[1]. This means that an individual can maintain stable social relationships with up to 150 people at any given time.

## Problem

As the social network grows to 150, it requires approximately 42% of its members' time to be spent in social grooming, building trust and social capital. 

## Consequence of problem

The concept of the Dunbar number has been applied to a wide range of fields, including sociology, psychology, and business. It suggests that social networks beyond a certain size become more difficult to manage and may eventually break down, as it becomes difficult to remember names, personalities, and histories of larger groups of people.  As the group size grows beyond this point there is a natural crossover point where a larger group would result in conflict in time spent between grooming and other sustaining activities.

## Solution patterns

Formal and informal social networks need to be structured so that they remain at or below the Dunbar's number.

It is, however, important to note that the Dunbar number is not a hard and fast rule, but rather an approximate guide. The number of social relationships an individual can maintain can vary depending on a range of factors such as cultural norms, personality, and communication technology.
