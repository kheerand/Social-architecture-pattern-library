# (041) Dunbar's number

<image>

## Context

Dunbar's number is 150, which defines the uper limit of the number of people humans can maintain meaningful personal relationships with[1].

## Problem

As the soclal network grows to 150, it requires approximately 42% of its members' time should be spent in social grooming, building trust and social capital. 

## Consequence of problem

As the group size grows beyond this point there is a natural crossover point where a larger group would result in conflict in time spent between grooming and other sustaining activities.

## Solution patterns

Formal and informal social networks need to be structured so that they remain at or below the Dunbar's number.
